- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ollie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning all kinds of languages (both human and computer)!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Advanced Computer Science** and **Software Development** at Monash University
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ollie.63395@gmail.com | https://www.linkedin.com/in/ollie-le-5546b1249/

I have a huge passion for **coding and writing algorithms**, but I'm also super passionate about **learning foreign languages**!

That's why my dream is to combine both of my interests into one - I want to build a Language Learning software that could help _everyone_ learn a new language in the most fun and efficient manner!

In my current profile, you will be able to find 3 projects:

**Pokemon Monster Battle**
- A simple battling version of the classic game PokÃ©mon, where exists a variety of monsters, stats, teams, and battling strategies!
- This project helped me practice my knowledge in OOP, time complexity analysis as well as data structures: Stacks, Queues, List ADTs, and Linked Lists :-D

**Gas Games Online Website**
- A customised online website that I created for one of the local Board Game shop here in Melbourne, Australia!
- This project helped me practice my knowledge in web developement using JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, PHP and Google DevTools ;-)

**Connect 4**
- A programmed version of the infamous game Connect 4!
- There are multiple player options - 2 players or 1 player against the CPU (4 difficulties levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extra Hard)
- This project helped me practice my knowledge in ArrayList and Recursion :-]
